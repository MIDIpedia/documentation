### Introduction
<a name="introduction"></a>

MIDI Linked Data proposes to use the data publishing method of [Linked Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) to interconnect symbolic music descriptions (to a great extent very similar to music scores) contained in MIDI files. By doing this, we believe there is a great opportunity to overcome traditional problems in music databases, such as interoperability, entity linking, and semantic relations. By doing this we can, for example, enrich the [DBpedia page of Hey Jude by the Beatles](http://dbpedia.org/page/Hey_Jude) with [all the notes and instruments of Hey Jude by the Beatles](purl.org/midi-ld/pattern/53f034801899d84fd061d73bd4716912).

### The MIDI Linked Data Cloud
<a name="tools"></a>

To achieve the goal of representing MIDI files as Linked Data, we need two things: a collection of MIDI files, and a "MIDI to RDF" conversion algorithm. The collections of MIDI files we currently represent as MIDI Linked Data can be found in [this list](https://github.com/midi-ld/sources). As for the algorithm, we use [**midi2rdf**](https://github.com/midi-ld/midi2rdf), a Python-based MIDI to RDF converter that uses a simple MIDI ontology to represent MIDI events. The product of applying this algorithm to the source MIDI files is what we call the *MIDI Linked Data Cloud*, which currently contains 10,215,557,355 RDF statements about 308,443 MIDI files.

MIDI files are then represented as RDF graphs which get connected by two different kinds of resources: *notes* and *programs*. Notes are simply the pitches that the MIDI format can represent, all listed in the small [MIDI notes](purl.org/midi-ld/notes/) dataset. Programs are all the instruments (grand piano, electric guitar, etc.) that can play in a MIDI file; they are also listed in a similar [MIDI programs](purl.org/midi-ld/programs/) dataset. These instruments contain links to their equivalent DBpedia resources, so all songs in the MIDI Linked Data Cloud are connected to the rest of the Web via these links.

### Using the data
<a name="usage"></a>

The data in the MIDI Linked Data Cloud can be accessed in different ways:

- Downloading a data [dump](http://midi-ld.amp.ops.labs.vu.nl/) (beware these are large files!)
- Sending queries in the [SPARQL query language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) to our [SPARQL endpoint](http://virtuoso-midi.amp.ops.labs.vu.nl/sparql)
- Using the MIDI-LD [RESTful API](http://grlc.io/api/midi-ld/queries/)

#### Dumps

#### SPARQL

When you query the SPARQL endpiont, you'll find this diagram useful:

### Tutorials

These tutorials (and more to come) will help you get your way around MIDI Linked Data.

- Tutorial on how to use [midi2rdf](https://github.com/midi-ld/midi2rdf) to convert your MIDI files to RDF (and back to MIDI)
- Tutorial on streaming your analog instrument output as MIDI Linked Data
- Tutorial on querying the MIDI Linked Data Cloud using SPARQL

### FAQ
<a name="faq"></a>

- **Q.** Do you support other formats than MIDI?
- **A.** This work is specifically tailored for MIDI. If you're looking for similar projects on other formats, like MusicXML, look [here](http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/musicml/musicml.owl) and [here](http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/musicml/confirmation.ttl).
- **Q.** Help! My queries have stopped working.
- **A.** Although we're working with a reasonably stable data model, we're constantly fixing bugs and generating new and improved versions of the MIDI Linked Data Cloud dataset. This has (and will) marginally affect this data model, eventually changing some URI naming schemes (e.g. "patterns" will soon be renamed into "pieces"; blame the musicologists!). We'll keep the documentation consistent with the most up-to-date version of the dataset, so please refer to it if something doesn't work (and, of course, your [bug reports](https://github.com/midi-ld/documentation/issues) will be very welcome!)
- **Q.** Help! URIs that use to work don't anymore.
- **A.** See previous answer.
- **Q.** I want to communicate something that doesn't fit your issue trackers.
- **A.** Drop us an [email](mailto:albert.meronyo@gmail.com)!
